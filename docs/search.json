Oxidized tetrazolium salt is water soluble, colorless in solution, and can freely diffuse into bacterial cells. Once inside the cell, tetrazolium is reduced by reducing agents like NADH an NADPH which are generated via cellular metabolism and catabolism. Once reduced tetrazolium is transformed into pink product. This assay measures the accumulation of reduced tetrazolium (colormetric absorbance at 590 nm) and hence the accumulation and concentration of reducing agents from cellular metabolism. This process will reflect both the concentration of cells in solution and per-capita concentration of reductant from central metabolism. There is a useful overview of the Tetrazolium colorometric procedure available here.\n\n\n3 Read data\n\n\nShow/hide code\n##### Growth summary data (e.g., AUC and growth rates from )\nmany_auc_res &lt;- readr::read_tsv(here::here(data, \"ecoplate_gcurve_auc_results.tsv\"))\nmany_spline_res &lt;- readr::read_tsv(here::here(data, \"ecoplate_gcurve_spline_results.tsv\"))\n\n##### Full growth curves\ngcurves &lt;- readr::read_tsv(here::here(data, \"ecoplate_gcurves_smooth.tsv\")) %&gt;% \n  arrange(strainID, well, plate_name) %&gt;% \n  group_by(strainID, evolution, plate_name, `carbon source`, well) %&gt;% \n  mutate(id = dplyr::cur_group_id()) %&gt;% \n  group_by(strainID, evolution, `carbon source`) %&gt;% \n  mutate(replicate = case_when(id == min(id) ~ 1,\n                               id == max(id) ~ n_distinct(id),\n                               TRUE ~ 2)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(replicate = LETTERS[replicate]) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-id) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() \n\n\n\n\n4 Plot growth curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Full growth curves of Citrobacter koseri HAMBI_1287 on 31 different carbon substrates and water in Biolog Ecoplates over 48 hours of growth.

The method is called nonparametric, because the growth rate is directly estimated from the smoothed data without being restricted to a specific model formula.\nFrom growthrates documentation:\n\nThe method was inspired by an algorithm of Kahm et al. (2010), with different settings and assumptions. In the moment, spline fitting is always done with log-transformed data, assuming exponential growth at the time point of the maximum of the first derivative of the spline fit. All the hard work is done by function smooth.spline from package stats, that is highly user configurable. Normally, smoothness is automatically determined via cross-validation. This works well in many cases, whereas manual adjustment is required otherwise, e.g. by setting spar to a fixed value [0, 1] that also disables cross-validation.\n\n\n3.1.1 Fit\n\n\nShow/hide code\nset.seed(45278)\nmany_spline &lt;- growthrates::all_splines(OD600_rollmean ~ hours | id, data = coculture_gcurves_sm, spar = 0.5)\n\nreadr::write_rds(many_spline, here::here(data, \"coculture_spline_fits\"))\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Results\n\n\nShow/hide code\nmany_spline_res &lt;- growthrates::results(many_spline)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Predictions\n\n\nShow/hide code\nmany_spline_xy &lt;- purrr::map(many_spline@fits, \\(x) data.frame(x = x@xy[1], y = x@xy[2])) %&gt;% \n  purrr::list_rbind(names_to = \"id\") \n\nmany_spline_fitted &lt;- purrr::map(many_spline@fits, \\(x) data.frame(x@FUN(x@obs$time, x@par))) %&gt;% \n  purrr::list_rbind(names_to = \"id\") %&gt;% \n  dplyr::rename(hours = time, predicted = y) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::left_join(coculture_gcurves_sm, by = dplyr::join_by(id, hours)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::group_by(id) %&gt;% \n  # this step makes sure we don't plot fits that go outside the range of the data\n  dplyr::mutate(predicted = dplyr::if_else(dplyr::between(predicted, min(OD600_rollmean), max(OD600_rollmean)), predicted, NA_real_)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Plot\n\n3.1.4.1 Plate01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: As in Figure 1.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe ancestral (streptomycin sensitive) and evolved (streptomycin resistant) forms of HAMBI_1287 and HAMBI_1977 were combined in 1:1 ratio in wells on a 96 deep-well plate and grown in batch serial transfer protocol. Every 48 hours, 10 μl of culture was transfered to 500 μl of 100% fresh R2A broth (50 fold dilution) at four different streptomycin levels: 0, 16, 64, and 256 μg/ml. Plates were incubated in the dark at 30C with shaking at 800 RPM for a total of eight growth cycles (16 days). For every growth cycle \\(\\mathrm{log_2(50)} \\approx 5.6\\) generations will have elapsed for a total of about 45 generations over eight cycles.\nNote we are using the Colony Forming Unit estimators provided in the paper:\n\nMartini KM, Boddu SS, Nemenman I, Vega NM. 2024.

    "text": "5.1 Spline based estiamte\nSmoothing splines are a quick method to estimate maximum growth. The method is called nonparametric, because the growth rate is directly estimated from the smoothed data without being restricted to a specific model formula.\nFrom growthrates documentation:\n\nThe method was inspired by an algorithm of Kahm et al. (2010), with different settings and assumptions. In the moment, spline fitting is always done with log-transformed data, assuming exponential growth at the time point of the maximum of the first derivative of the spline fit. All the hard work is done by function smooth.spline from package stats, that is highly user configurable. Normally, smoothness is automatically determined via cross-validation. This works well in many cases, whereas manual adjustment is required otherwise, e.g. by setting spar to a fixed value [0, 1] that also disables cross-validation.\n\n\n5.1.1 Fit\n\n\nShow/hide code\nset.seed(45278)\nmany_spline &lt;- growthrates::all_splines(OD600_rollmean ~ hours | id, data = ecoplate_gcurves_sm, spar = 0.5)\n\nreadr::write_rds(many_spline, here::here(data, \"spline_fits\"))\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Results\n\n\nShow/hide code\nmany_spline_res &lt;- growthrates::results(many_spline)\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Predictions\n\n\nShow/hide code\nmany_spline_xy &lt;- purrr::map(many_spline@fits, \\(x) data.frame(x = x@xy[1], y = x@xy[2])) %&gt;% \n  purrr::list_rbind(names_to = \"id\") \n\nmany_spline_fitted &lt;- purrr::map(many_spline@fits, \\(x) data.frame(x@FUN(x@obs$time, x@par))) %&gt;% \n  purrr::list_rbind(names_to = \"id\") %&gt;% \n  dplyr::rename(hours = time, predicted = y) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::left_join(ecoplate_gcurves_sm, by = dplyr::join_by(id, hours)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::group_by(id) %&gt;% \n  # this step makes sure we don't plot fits that go outside the range of the data\n  dplyr::mutate(predicted = dplyr::if_else(dplyr::between(predicted, min(OD600_rollmean), max(OD600_rollmean)), predicted, NA_real_)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Plot\n\n5.1.4.1 Plate01 (ANC_1287)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: As in Figure 1.
